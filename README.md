# Transport-Demand-prediction
The business challenge is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the number of seats Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride on a specific route, date, and time, considering 14 different routes originating from various towns and ending in Nairobi.

1. Built a regression model for Transport Demand Prediction by experimenting with Linear regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient boosting.

2. Performed data cleaning, outlier handling, EDA to gain meaningful insights, and Feature Engineering to extract the important features for the best model performance.

3. Tuned the hyperparameters to get optimal model performance evaluated models based on different evaluation metrics and also had a rough idea of feature importance for each model.

4. XGBoost and Random Forest were the best model.
